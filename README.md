This Forbidden Lands character sheet is designed to make tracking various dice pools easier by using paperclips. Tracks for likely-to-change pools (like Strength, Willpower, or Torches) are moved to the edge of the sheet where the player may use a paperclip to mark the transient value. Permanent values may be marked by writing directly on the sheet (circling the permanent Strength value, for example). I take no credit for this paperclip idea; to the best of my knowledge, Shawn Tomkin, author of the IRONSWORN RPG, came up with it. Kudos!
